Things I learnt with this project.
Silly mistakes are made passed 12am at night. Especially when you use a version control system you've never touched before.
You may notice the commit history goes through an absolutely abysmal and unforgiveable streak of committing to master.
I was pushing to my local directory, but not updating the remotes. I ended up deleting the local respository and pulling a fresh project from github.
I lost a few hours of photoshopped files work due to this error.

Looking back I should have left it until the morning and calmly gone through and recovered the files. I should have also created a new Dev branch (and not commit patches to master... very bad practice).

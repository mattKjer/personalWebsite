# This website was created with a bootstrap foundation and built upon to make it something i'm proud to call my own.

##
Known bugs:
This website does not scale accordingly with Ultrawide monitors, or those greater than a 2560 resolution.

Things I learnt with this project.
Silly mistakes are made committing past 12am at night. Especially when you use a version control system you've never touched before.
You may notice the commit history goes through an absolutely abysmal and unforgiveable streak of committing to master.
I was pushing to my local directory, but not updating the remotes. I ended up deleting the local respository and pulling a fresh project from github.
I lost a few hours of photoshopped files work due to this error.

Looking back I should have left it until the morning and calmly gone through and recovered the files. I should have also created a new Dev branch (and not commit patches to master... very bad practice).

Outcomes: Do not guess with version control.
